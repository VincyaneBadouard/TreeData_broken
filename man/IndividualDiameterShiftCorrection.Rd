\usage{
IndividualDiameterShiftCorrection(
  DBHCor,
  Time,
  cresc,
  cresc_abs,
  cresc_abn,
  coef = 0.9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBHCor}{Diameter vector (numeric)}

\item{Time}{Time vector (numeric)}

\item{cresc}{Annual diameter increment with NA instead of abnormal values
(numeric)}

\item{cresc_abs}{Absolute diameter increment (not divided by time between 2
values) with NA instead of abnormal values (numeric)}

\item{cresc_abn}{Abnormal diameter increment positions (numeric)}

\item{coef}{description... (numeric)}

\item{DataTree}{A dataset corresponding to a single tree/stem's (1 IdTree/IdStem)
measurements (data.frame or data.table)
To be filled in if you want the column "DiameterCorrectionMeth" (correction
method) to be filled in the corresponding row.
Otherwise leave DataTree = NULL}
}
\value{
List of 2 objects:
\itemize{
\item DBHCor (numeric vector): corrected by the method
\item DataTree (data.table): with the \emph{DiameterCorrectionMeth} column filled with
correction method ("weighted mean", "shift realignment")
}
}
\description{
Correct for 'shift' diameter errors, based on the individual's
non-abnormal growths. Greater weight is given to growths recorded at a
diameter close to the one to correct. The weighted mean of the
non-abnormal growths is computed and applied to correct the abnormal
diameter.
}
\details{
Method:
\enumerate{
\item Correct the 1st value of the shift ("weighted mean"):
}
\itemize{
\item Compute the absolute difference between the DBH to correct and the others
\item Give respective weights to the growth (cresc) values according to the
distance to the DBH to correct
\item Compute the weighted mean of the growths (cresc)
\item Apply the weighted mean to correct the abnormal DBH
}
\enumerate{
\item Correct the following values of the shift ("shift realignment"):
Each value = the previous value + initial growth
}
}
