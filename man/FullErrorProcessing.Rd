\arguments{
\item{Data}{Dataset (data.frame or data.table)}

\item{DetectOnly}{TRUE: Only detect errors, FALSE: detect and correct errors
(Default: FALSE) (logical)}

\item{Source}{(character) To correct and standardise, you can choose between:
\itemize{
\item "TPL": \emph{The Plant List} (http://www.theplantlist.org/) (faster but based
on the 2013 taxonomy)
\item "WFO": \emph{World Flora Online} (http://www.worldfloraonline.org/) (long time
but based on the 2022 taxonomy)
\item NULL: if only error detection (DetectOnly = TRUE)
}}

\item{WFOData}{To be filled in if the argument \code{Source} = "WFO". Data set
with the static copy of the \emph{World Flora Online} (WFO) Taxonomic Backbone
data (from http://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData.) (data.frame or
data.table)}

\item{InvariantColumns}{Vector with the names of the columns that are
supposed to have always the same value for each measurement of the same
tree (character). It is recommended to use the columns that have already
been \strong{corrected}, such as the columns containing the corrected botanical
information.}

\item{DeathConfirmation}{Number of times (censuses) needed for an unseen tree
to be considered dead (numeric)  (Default = 2 censuses)}

\item{UseSize}{Use the size presence as a witness of the living status of the
tree (logical) (Default = FALSE)}

\item{RemoveRBeforeAlive}{Do you want to delete the rows about the tree
before it was seen alive for the 1st time? (logical)}

\item{RemoveRAfterDeath}{After correction do you want to delete the rows
concerning the tree after its death? (logical)}

\item{DefaultHOM}{Default Height Of Measurement in meter (Default: 1.3 m)
(numeric, 1 value)}

\item{TaperParameter}{Taper parameter (unitless) formula (function)
Default: \emph{TaperParameter = 0.156 - 0.023 log(DAB) - 0.021 log(HOM)}
of Cushman et al.2021.
With:
\itemize{
\item \emph{DAB}: Diameter Above Buttress (in cm)
\item \emph{HOM}: Height Of Measurement (in m)
}}

\item{TaperFormula}{Taper formula (function)
Default: \emph{DAB / (e^(- TaperParameter (HOM - DefaultHOM)))}
of Cushman et al.2021.
With:
\itemize{
\item \emph{DAB}: Diameter Above Buttress (in cm)
\item \emph{HOM}: Height Of Measurement (in m)
\item \emph{DefaultHOM}:  Default Height Of Measurement (in m)
\item \emph{TaperParameter}: Taper parameter (unitless)
}}

\item{KeepMeas}{In case of \strong{multiple diameter measurements} in the same
census year:
Possible values: "MaxHOM", "MaxDate" (character).
\itemize{
\item "MaxHOM": apply the correction to the measurement taken at the
\strong{highest POM}
\item "MaxDate": apply the correction to the \strong{most recent measurement} (same
year but more recent date)
}}

\item{MaxDBH}{Maximum possible DBH (Diameter at the default HOM) of your
stand in cm (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{PositiveGrowthThreshold}{in cm/year: a tree
widening by more than this value is considered abnormal (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{NegativeGrowthThreshold}{in cm/census: the possible
positive measurement error (+n) cannot be corrected until the growth
appears abnormal, but a negative measurement error can be allowed until -n
(a tree does not decrease). Thus the positive measurement error (+n) is
"compensated". (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{Pioneers}{Scientific names of the pioneer species of the site, as in
the \code{ScientificName_TreeDataCor} column (characters vector)}

\item{PioneersGrowthThreshold}{in cm/year: a tree of a pioneer species that
widens by more than this value is considered abnormal (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{WhatToCorrect}{Possible values: "POM change", "punctual", "shift"
(character)
\itemize{
\item "POM change": detect POM change in the column \code{POM} and correct the
Diameter values from it.
\item "punctual": detect if the error is punctual and correct it by
interpolation.
\item "shift": detect if there is a shift of several Diameter values and
links them to the 1st measurements set.
}}

\item{CorrectionType}{Possible values: "linear", "quadratic",
"individual", "phylogenetic hierarchical" (character).
\itemize{
\item "linear": interpolation by linear regression of the individual annual
growth over time.
\item "quadratic": interpolation by quadratic regression  of the individual
annual growth over time.
\item "individual": replace abnormal growth by interpolation from the
individual values.
\item "phylogenetic hierarchical": replace abnormal growth with the average
growth of other trees in the dataset, at the specific, genus, family
or stand level, within a DBH range of x cm (\emph{DBHRange} argument).
If the number of these trees < n (\emph{MinIndividualNbr} argument)
at the specific level, we switch to the genus level etc.
}}

\item{DBHRange}{DBH range in cm to take into account to select other trees in
the dataset to apply "phylogenetic hierarchical" correction (Default: 10
cm) (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{MinIndividualNbr}{Minimum number of individuals to take into account in
"phylogenetic hierarchical" correction (Default: 5) (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{OtherCrit}{Other criteria to select the individuals used for the
calculation of the mean growth in the "phylogenetic hierarchical"
correction. Give the name of the column(s) for which the individuals must
have the same value as the tree to correct (e.g. c("Plot", "Subplot"))
(character)}

\item{Digits}{Number of decimal places to be used in the \code{DBHCor} column
(Default: 1L) (integer)}

\item{DBHCorForDeadTrees}{(logical) TRUE: return DBHCor also for dead trees.
FALSE: do not return DBHCor for dead trees. In this case it is advisable to
have corrected the tree life status with the \emph{StatusCorrection()} function.}

\item{coef}{description... (numeric)}

\item{MinDBH}{Minimum diameter of trees inventoried according to your
protocol (in cm) (numeric, 1 value) (Default = 10 cm)}
}
\value{
The original dataset (data.table) with a \emph{Comment} column containing
information on the errors detected per row, the correction columns, and
columns containing correction methods.
