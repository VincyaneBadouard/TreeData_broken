\usage{
RecruitmentCorrection(
  Data,
  KeepMeas = c("MaxHOM", "MaxDate"),
  MinDBH = 10,
  PositiveGrowthThreshold = 5,
  InvariantColumns = c("Site", "Genus_TreeDataCor", "Species_TreeDataCor",
    "Family_TreeDataCor", "ScientificName_TreeDataCor"),
  DetectOnly = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{(data.frame or data.table)
The dataset should preferably contain the column of corrected diameters:
'DBH_TreeDataCor', otherwise the function will take the column 'Diameter'}

\item{KeepMeas}{In case of \strong{multiple diameter measurements} in the same
census year, on which to apply the correction:
Possible values: "MaxHOM", "MaxDate" (character).
\itemize{
\item "MaxHOM": apply the correction to the measurement taken at the
\strong{highest POM}
\item "MaxDate": apply the correction to the \strong{most recent measurement} (same
year but more recent date)
}}

\item{MinDBH}{Minimum diameter of trees inventoried according to your
protocol (in cm) (numeric, 1 value) (Default = 10 cm)}

\item{PositiveGrowthThreshold}{A tree widening by more than x cm/year is
considered abnormal (numeric, 1 value) (Default = 5 cm)}

\item{InvariantColumns}{Vector with the names of the columns that are
supposed to have always the same value for each measurement of the same
tree (character)}

\item{DetectOnly}{TRUE: Only detect errors, FALSE: detect and correct errors
(logical)}
}
\value{
Add rows for forgotten recruits with them estimated DBH in the
'Diameter_TreeDataCor' column, create a 'CorrectedRecruit' col (logical)
and fill the 'Comment' column : "This DBH is/was the 1st recorded for this
tree, according to its annual growth and the census done for this plot, it
should have been recruited earlier according to your protocol (MinDBH)."
}
\description{
RecruitmentCorrection
}
\details{
If the size of the tree has never changed, or if there is only one
value the same value is kept for the added forgotten recruits. If the
Diameter has not been corrected ('Diameter_TreeDataCor' column does not
exist), the function will create it for the forgotten recruits. It is
strongly recommended to correct the Diameter before correcting the recruits
