\usage{
RecruitmentCorrectionByTree(
  DataTree,
  MinDBH = 10,
  PositiveGrowthThreshold = 5,
  InvariantColumns = c("Site", "GenusCor", "SpeciesCor", "FamilyCor",
    "ScientificNameCor"),
  PlotCensuses,
  DetectOnly = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DataTree}{A dataset corresponding to a single tree's (1 IdTree/Idstem)
measurements (data.frame or data.table). The dataset should preferably
contain the column of corrected diameters: 'Diameter_TreeDataCor', otherwise the function
will take the column "Diameter"}

\item{MinDBH}{Minimum diameter of trees inventoried according to your
protocol (in cm) (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{PositiveGrowthThreshold}{A tree widening by more than x
cm/year is considered abnormal (numeric, 1 value)}

\item{InvariantColumns}{Vector with the names of the columns that are
supposed to have always the same value for each measurement of the same
tree (character)}

\item{PlotCensuses}{Census years for the plot in which the tree is (integer)}

\item{DetectOnly}{TRUE: Only detect errors, FALSE: detect and correct errors
(logical)}
}
\value{
Add rows for forgotten recruits with them estimated DBH in the
'Diameter_TreeDataCor' column, create a 'CorrectedRecruit' column (logical)
and fill the 'Comment' column : "This DBH is/was the 1st recorded for this
tree, according to its annual growth and the census done for this plot, it
should have been recruited earlier according to your protocol (MinDBH)."
}
\description{

}
\details{
If the size of the tree has never changed, or if there is only one
value the same value is kept for the added forgotten recruits.
If the Diameter has not been corrected (Diameter_TreeDataCor column does
not exist), the function will create it for the forgotten recruits. It is
strongly recommended to correct the Diameter before correcting the
recruits.

1994.
