StatusCorrection(
  Data,
  InvariantColumns = c("Site", "Genus_TreeDataCor", "Species_TreeDataCor",
    "Family_TreeDataCor", "ScientificName_TreeDataCor"),

\arguments{
\item{Data}{Dataset (data.frame or data.table)
The \emph{LifeStatus} column must be coded as:
- TRUE = alive,
- FALSE = dead,
- NA = unseen
The \emph{Plot} column is needed to add rows to the census where the plot was
inventoried, where the tree was alive, but not recorded.}

\item{InvariantColumns}{Vector with the names of the columns that are
supposed to have always the same value for each measurement of the same
tree (character). It is recommended to use the columns that have already
been \strong{corrected}, such as the columns containing the corrected botanical
information.}

\item{DeathConfirmation}{Number of times (censuses) needed for an unseen tree
to be considered dead (numeric)  (Default = 2 censuses)}

\item{UseSize}{Use the size presence as a witness of the living status of the
tree (logical) (Default = FALSE)}

\item{AddRowsForForgottenCensuses}{TRUE: adds rows for forgotten censuses
between 2 'Alive', FALSE: does not add any rows (logical)}

\item{DetectOnly}{TRUE: Only detect errors, FALSE: detect and correct errors
(logical)}

\item{RemoveRBeforeAlive}{Do you want to delete the rows about the tree
before it was seen alive for the 1st time? (logical)}

\item{RemoveRAfterDeath}{After correction do you want to delete the rows
concerning the tree after its death? (logical)}
}
\value{
Fill the \emph{Comment} column with error type informations. If
\emph{DetectOnly} = FALSE, add a \emph{LifeStatus_TreeDataCor} column with the
corrected trees life status.
}
\description{
Detect errors, or detect errors and correct, the tree life
status evolution over the censuses.
Inspired by the code of Nino Page package (ForestData::correct_alive() and
.correct_alive_tree())

\itemize{
\item if UseSize : if Diameter != NA -> Alive
If (the value in bold is modified by the value given after the arrow):
(the ">" gives the chronological order of the sequence)
\item \emph{Dead} > Alive -> NA
\item add rows for the forgotten censuses between 2 'Alive' if chosen
\item Alive > \emph{Dead}/\emph{NA} > Alive -> Alive
\item Alive > \emph{NA} > Dead -> NA
\item Alive > \emph{Dead} > NA -> Dead
